Get your key at https://build.nvidia.com/\n\n**ElevenLabs API Key**: Required for text-to-speech voice synthesis in the AI interaction system. Sign up at https://elevenlabs.io/ to obtain your API key.\n\nBoth keys are securely passed as environment variables to the container and are not stored."

Wait for the container to pull and start (first run may take 5-10 minutes)\n5. Once complete, **service links will appear** for:\n   - noVNC Simulation (port 6080)\n   - Pipecat Dashboard (port 7860)\n\nThe deployment uses Docker Compose with GPU passthrough and host networking for optimal performance."
